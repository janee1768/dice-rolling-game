# 🎲 Dice Rolling Game  

A simple **Python-based two-player Dice Rolling Game** where players take turns rolling a die to reach a score of 100. The game includes special rules for rolling a six, making it exciting and unpredictable.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Two-player gameplay.  
- Players roll a die (1–6) each turn.  
- Rolling a **6** grants an **extra turn**.  
- First player to reach **100 points** wins.  
- Interactive console-based experience.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. Player 1 rolls the die and their score is updated.  
2. If they roll a **6**, they get an **extra roll** until they stop rolling sixes.  
3. Player 2 takes their turn with the same rules.  
4. The cycle continues until one player’s score reaches **100 or more**.  
5. The winning player is announced in the console.
