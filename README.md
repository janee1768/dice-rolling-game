# dice-rolling-game
ðŸ“„ Description
The Dice Rolling Game is a fun Python project that simulates a dice game between two players. The game starts with both players having a score of 0. Each player takes turns rolling a dice, and the number they roll gets added to their total score.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.A random number between 1 and 6 is rolled for each player using randint().

2.If a player rolls a 6, they get another turn immediately.

3.The game continues until one player reaches 100 points or more.

4.Once a player crosses 100, the game ends and declares that player the winner.

âœ… Features
~Two-player automatic gameplay

~Random dice rolls from 1 to 6

~Bonus roll when a player gets a 6

~Winning condition: reach 100 points first

~Simple terminal-based interface

ðŸ§  What You Learn
>Using while loops for game flow

>Nested loops for bonus turns

>Generating random numbers using random.randint()

>Tracking and updating scores

>Writing game logic with if and break statements

This project is perfect for beginners who want to build a complete game using basic Python programming concepts. Itâ€™s easy to understand, fun to play, and can be expanded with more rules or a better interface in the future.
